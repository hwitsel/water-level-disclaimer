**Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy explains how the Wadden Water Level app handles your information. The app is provided free of charge by Hugo Witsel.

The app retrieves water level data from the public Rijkswaterstaat API. It does not require you to create an account or enter personal details. We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information.

**Information We Collect**

The app itself does not gather personal data. In the rare event of a crash or other technical issue, the operating system may provide log information such as your device model, iOS version, and time of the error. This log data is used solely to investigate and resolve problems with the app.

**How We Use Data**

Any diagnostic information is used only for troubleshooting and improving the app. It is never sold or shared with third parties for marketing purposes.

**Third‑Party Services**

The app connects to Rijkswaterstaat's services to download water level measurements. Those services may record standard network information (such as IP address) when you request data. We do not control the policies of Rijkswaterstaat; please refer to their documentation for details.

**Security**

Because we store no personal data, your privacy risks are minimal. Still, we take reasonable steps to keep diagnostic information secure and delete it when no longer needed.

**Children’s Privacy**

The app is not directed at children under 13. As no personal data is collected, we do not knowingly store information about children.

**Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app repository.
